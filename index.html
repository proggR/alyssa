                        My passion for recreation therapy began when I worked in an adult day program with clients who were living with Alzheimer's or Dementia. This was my first exposure to recreation therapy and I had very little knowledge of this professional field. I had been searching for a summer job before my third year of university and stumbled across a student activity aide position. I had a friend who worked at this particular long-term care facility as a recreation therapist, and she was constantly telling me about the activities she was preparing for at work. She would tell me about her plans for all of the upcoming events including concerts, dances, crafts, theme days, strawberry socials, and so much more. It sounded fun, but I didn't truly understand what her profession was until I started the job as an activity aide. <br/><br/>

                    </p>
                    <p class="collapsing">
                        On my first day, I was terrified to because I was in very unfamiliar territory. Starting a new job is never easy, but this was different since I had no experience in a healthcare setting. I felt uneasy when the first client sat down beside me as I waited for everyone to arrive for the day. The other employees introduced us to each other and he sat down beside me, smiling. He immediately began telling me about the trip he was about to go on with his wife and how he was very excited to see her hometown again. As I listened to him tell me stories about his previous trips, I began to feel more at ease as I remembered that a person is not their disease or disability. This client was so friendly, smiling and greeting everyone as they came in. Once everyone had arrived, the staff introduced me to the clients and explained that I would be helping out for the summer. By the end of my first day, my head was spinning with thoughts about this field I had just discovered. The activities of the day included music, cards, knitting, a walk in the garden, and bingo. I was no longer anxious or uncomfortable, instead I was excited and optimistic about a new future career opportunity. By the end of my first week, I had made the decision to find a way to make recreation therapy my new career path.
                    </p>
                    <p class="collapsing">
                        I was successful in steering myself into a recreation therapy program after completing my music degree at Queen's. I am now finishing the final course for my diploma through distance education and I am beyond excited to begin my career in recreation therapy. I feel that it is important to reflect on my personal and professional philosophy so that I have guidelines to follow when conducting myself at work. As a future recreation therapist, I aim to be compassionate, caring, and empathetic with all clients that I will work with. These traits are extremely important when working in any healthcare setting, but I feel they are especially important when working with seniors. From my studies, I have learned that the process of aging is difficult because it can stimulate feelings of loneliness and isolation. There are also negative stereotypes that surround the aging population, and I feel that recreation therapists must do their best to prevent those stereotypes from affecting the leisure interests and lifestyle of clients. By showing empathy and compassion, I will be able to show clients that any leisure activity can be modified if needed and that nothing is impossible.

                    <p class="collapsing">
                        In my career as a recreation therapist, I aim to be organized, prepared, and knowledgeable everyday. I want to be the best I can be in my profession and in order to be that person, I need to head to work everyday prepared and organized for the programs of the day. If the activities continue to be well organized and executed, then the clients will get more enjoyment and satisfaction from the programs. I also want to be knowledgeable in my career as a recreation therapist so that my clients know they can trust me. Personally, I would be more willing to participate in an activity that had a confident and educated leader and I know that clients will likely feel the same.

                    <p class="collapsing">
                        That single summer working as a student activity aide really changed my life and significantly altered my future. That experience made me realize that positive experiences in a recreation or leisure activity can really change someone's outlook on life. A balanced and healthy leisure lifestyle can make a day better for a client who maybe would have spent the day being alone otherwise. I think the profession of recreation therapy is going to be very satisfying and rewarding, and I can't wait to begin my future career.<br/><br/>

                        During a four week practicum placement, I worked closely with the manager of programming, assisting with administrative duties and helping with the senior programs. I organized the adult,
senior, and youth sections of the 2015 leisure guide and created the Older Adult monthly newsletters. I also developed a marking scheme for the selection of the 2015 Pan Am torchbearer for the Town of Huntsville. My practicum placement provided me with many opportunities to learn more about recreation programming in a new setting.<br/><br/>

I continued to volunteer at Providence Manor while attending Queen's University.
